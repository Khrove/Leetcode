list = ["apple", "banana", "pear", "excalibur", "remus", "bingo"]

# Generic for loop
# for item in list:
#     print(item)

# Looping with a length of list, prints out each value at a specific index
# for i in range(len(list)):
#     print(list[i])

# Using a while loop to print through each position in a list
# i = 0
# while i < len(list):
#     print(list[i])
#     i = i + 1

# List comprehension, apparently this is used to shorten the notation of a for loop
[print(i) for i in list]
