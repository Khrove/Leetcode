/**
 * @Pattern Divide and Conquer
 * @Desc This pattern involves dividing a data set into smaller chunks and then repeating a process with a sub set of data
 * 
 * @Benefits This pattern can tremendously decrease time complexity
 * 
 * @Example Given a sorted array of integers, write a function called search, that accepts a value and returns the index where the value passed to the function is located. If the value is not found, return -1.

console.log(search([1, 2, 3, 4, 5, 6], 4)); // 3
